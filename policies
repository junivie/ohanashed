    <span style="text-align: justify;">
      <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><br>
        The <strong>OHANA SHED</strong> clinic highly encourage the Pet Owners to book first an appointment before visiting the clinic to have a secured slot for consultation and visit.<br>
        <br>
        1. Appointment should be booked before visiting to clinic, except for emergency care patients. <br>
        2. All pets are required to be in leash or placed on pet carriers before entering the clinic to avoid any clash between animals in waiting area.<br>
        3. Waiting room for Boarding pets are different from pets with their owners around. Boarding pets do not necessarily go to clinic for consultation, but can be advantage for pet owners who do not have the ample of time for a fixed scheduled consultation. Consultation for boarding pets depends on vacant and availability of the vet doctors.
